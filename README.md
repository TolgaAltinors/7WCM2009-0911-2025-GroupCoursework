Main.kt will be the command line application.

There are 3 other files that will contain the functions which will be triggered from main.kt

I put some program logic in main.kt just for reference. We can discuss how we want to implement later.

The idea is that we can work on one of them each.

sum.kt
temperature.kt
factorial.kt
